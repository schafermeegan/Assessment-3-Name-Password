1. Create a service file named sign-in-service.js in the service folder. Declare a service named SignInService which has one method named setInfo. setInfo has one parameter and the parameter is assigned to a property of the service named info. setInfo simply logs the value to the console.

2. Finally, create a component file in the components folder named signIn.js. Create a component named signIn that renders two inputs and a button. 

3. One input will take a name and the other will take a password. If the user enters information into the two inputs and clicks the button, the information from the inputs are passed to the service as a single object and logged to the console.
